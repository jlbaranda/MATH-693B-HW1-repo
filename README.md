# Please read
I am using this public repository to see how github repositories work, I deleted my previous README file. I would need to look and see how I may be able to go back in time and see how I could recover and make changes.

# Using LATEX
On another note I learned I am able to use LATEX by using the dollar sign symbol twice before and after the information I want to change. For example

$${\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)  }$$
